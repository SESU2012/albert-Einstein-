    <h1>ALBERT EINSTEIN</h1>
   </header> 
   <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of
        relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. He was born on
        March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German
        Empire.
      </p>
      <h2>Life and Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        Einstein's contributions to science revolutionized our understanding of
        the universe. His famous equation, E=mc^2, demonstrates the relationship
        between energy and mass. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921
        for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.
      </p>
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Albert Einstein's work laid the foundation for many scientific
        advancements and continues to inspire researchers and students
        worldwide. His insights into the nature of space, time, and energy have
        had a profound impact on the field of physics.
